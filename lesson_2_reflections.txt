What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Creates .git folder- to get git to work...duh

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Commit items in staging area - not wd (sa is bridge between wd and rep)
	hmmm not sure- try out commit arrangements before finalising?

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	Use git diff --staging which compares staging area and repo. check 1 change. or use git diff- make compare working dir and sa- check only 1 logical change in sa

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	When trying out experimental features and still want a main version of the game to work on e.g. porting app for web or new language
