What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Creates .git folder- to get git to work...duh

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Commit items in staging area - not wd (sa is bridge between wd and rep)
	hmmm not sure- try out commit arrangements before finalising?
