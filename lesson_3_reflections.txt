When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When sharing with others (e.g. opensource) or collaborating with multiple authors
  Could also serve as additional off-site backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	In case someone has edited branch and you don't want latest/modified version yet
	Or if no internet so only pull when convenient

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Fork = copy of someone else's github repo, stored on repo- use when want to edit / use someone else's repo but don't have permission to collaborate - like clone between github
	clone - copy normally github to local or local to local. fork is a type of clone but github to github
	branch- add new tip on repo e.g. for dev version

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	Can see what changes have been made to remote when pulling, before incorporating changes. esp if collab and you've done other work since.
